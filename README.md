# UI-MISSING-PROPERTIES-CHECKER

How it works

this script fetches the content of the environment.prod.ts files from different folders in your GitHub repository, extracts the properties from each file, and identifies missing properties by comparing them with the properties of the base folder's file. The missing properties are then logged for each folder, helping you identify configuration discrepancies across different environments.
